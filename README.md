🌐 Khaled Bahnawy — Flutter Developer Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website built with Flutter Web, designed to showcase my work as a Flutter Developer.
It highlights my skills, projects, and experience in building cross-platform mobile and web applications with clean architecture, strong UI/UX, and modern development practices.

The portfolio includes:

🎨 A fully responsive and modern design inspired by professional developer portfolios.

🧠 Smooth animations, glassmorphism, and blur effects for an elegant look.

🧭 Navigation powered by onGenerateRoute for clean and scalable routing.

📱 Support for multiple screen sizes using flutter_screenutil.

💡 Custom reusable components such as buttons, cards, and sections.

🚀 Built entirely with Flutter Web — no HTML/CSS required.
